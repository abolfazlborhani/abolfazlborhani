# Hi there, I'm Abolfazl 👋

**Generative AI Engineer | AI Agent Developer**

I specialize in bridging the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and real-world actions. My focus is on architecting autonomous agents and designing complex automation workflows that solve business problems.

# 🚀 What I Do

*   **AI Agent Architecture:** Designing agents that can reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously.
*   **Workflow Orchestration (n8n):** Building advanced, logic-heavy automation flows to integrate AI with enterprise systems.
*   **Generative AI:** Leveraging the latest LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude opus 4.5, gemini 3 pro) for semantic understanding and content generation.

# 🌱 Current Focus

I am currently focused on building **Agentic Workflows** where AI doesn't just chat, but *acts*—automating complex processes by connecting LLMs to external APIs and internal data sources via **n8n**.
